# --- Train the Model ---
# The data argument should point to the dataset.yaml file downloaded by Roboflow
# This file is usually located in the downloaded dataset directory.
# Example: os.path.join(dataset.location, "data.yaml")

    # Learning rate scheduling is handled automatically by Ultralytics' optimizer
    # You can customize optimizer and LR scheduler in train() arguments if needed
    # e.g., optimizer='Adam', lr0=0.01, lrf=0.001
)

# --- Evaluate the Model ---
metrics = model.val() # Evaluate the model on the validation set

# Print detailed evaluation metrics
print("\n--- Evaluation Metrics ---")
print(f"mAP50-95: {metrics.box.map}")

print(f"mAP75: {metrics.box.map75}")
# You can access other metrics like:
# metrics.box.maps # list of mAPs for each class
# metrics.speed # inference speed metrics

# --- Save the Model ---
# Ultralytics automatically saves the best model as 'best.pt' and the last model as 'last.pt'
# in 'runs/detect/trainX/weights/' directory (where X is the run number).
# To load a saved model:
# loaded_model = YOLO('runs/detect/trainX/weights/best.pt')
# You can also export it to other formats if needed
# model.export(format="onnx") # export the model to ONNX format

print("Model training and evaluation complete!")
